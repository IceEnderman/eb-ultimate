NOTE:
This game can either be used as an Earthbound Hack or a standalone PC game (Both Methods require an Earthbound ROM to play)

Earthbound Ultimate is a Sonic 3 AIR-style remake of Earthbound with tons of extra features like an options menu and the option to enable Red Text boxes under the name ''Blood Flavour''
(because that's the most fitting name I could come up with for it)
